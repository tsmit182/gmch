			<h1>Raging Bender</h1> <hr>
			<p>Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Also Zoidberg.</p>			<ol>

			<p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it&hellip; then perhaps gifts! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!</p>

			<h1>In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela</h1>
			<p>Soothe us with sweet lies. Noooooo! How much did you make me?</p>
			<h2>A Leela of Her Own</h2>
			<p>That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. She also liked to shut up! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Your best is an idiot!</p>

			<h4>Hell Is Other Robots</h4>
			<p>Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. I don't want to be rescued. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!</p>
